    <h3>Raised in CO and Bangkok, Iâ€™ve cut my teeth in Seattle pursuing science, building sites, and doing pure programming.
    I emphasize functionality in my sites and work hard to make sure they are as versatile as possible, using JS, Python, and the rest of the full stack to the best of its capabilities.
    Currently seeking work in the greater Seattle area.</h3>
